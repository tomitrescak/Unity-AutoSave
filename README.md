Unity AutoSave
==============

```
No more lost work!
```

This unity plugin allows you to automatically save your work every specific time interval. 
The plugin does not require the editor window to be visible at all times and is running on background from the 
moment you open your project!

Installation
==============

Copy files into your scripts folder, maintining them in the **Editor** folder


Usage
==============

In `Window > AutoSave` configure the time interval of the auto save. 
Here you can also enable/disable the autosave as well as configure the verbosity of the plugin.
